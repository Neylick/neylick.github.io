						<h2 class="mb-auto"> About me </h2>
						<p3>
							Since I was a kid, I was always interested in video games, playing them and understanding how to create them. <br>
							I started programming after High School, successfully completing a Double Degree in Computer Science and Maths, at Paris-Saclay University. <br>
							Starting my Masterâ€™s in Human-Computer Interaction, I quickly realized that the field didn't match what I wanted to achieve. <br>
							I ultimately dropped out after validating my first year, while working on side projects, notably two 2D games and engines using DirectX 11 and OpenGL in C++. <br>
							Since them, I've been working indie to get a better Portfolio to get into the gaming industry as a programmer.
