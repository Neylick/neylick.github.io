						<h2 class="mb-auto"> About me </h2>
						<p3>
							Since I was a kid, I was always interested in video games, playing them and understanding how to create them. <br>
							I started programming after high school, successfully completing a Double Degree in Computer Science and Maths, at Paris-Saclay University. <br>
							Starting my masterâ€™s in Human-Computer Interaction, I quickly realized that the curriculum was not compatible with my career plans. <br>
							After completing my first year, I focused on developping new projects, notably two 2D games and engines using DirectX 11 and OpenGL in C++. <br>
							Since them, I've been learning and developping a better portfolio to get into the gaming industry as a programmer.
